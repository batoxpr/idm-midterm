# Midterm

Dynamic Web Application with professor James Ayres

Bato Batbileg

Project Requirements:
1) Use two sources of data ->
- API 1: Bored API: Random activity suggestion (https://www.boredapi.com/)
- API 2: Cocktail API: Random cocktail name, an accompanying image link, along with ingredients list and instructions. (https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php)

2) Display the two sources of data in the same UI: 
Both the suggested activity and the recommended drink are shown together in a single layout.


3) Have the UI be interactive
As the user hovers over the cocktail image, 
- The website displays the ingredient list and instructions.
- The brightness of the image changes and turns into a background.
- The image container is displayed with a float animation
- The layout shrinks and extends according to the @media screen size (smaller on mobile and tablet)


4) Have the UI change based on the data
Depending on the number of persons the suggested activity requires, the UI will display a single icon or a group icon GIFs.

5) Have the site styled
- Animated gradient title
- Pastel color palette
- Minimalist layout
